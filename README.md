# Run the application

## Using psql to create the required table

To access the docker container command line from Windows Powershell just run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it student-management-postgresql-1 /bin/bash
```

If `student-management-postgresql-1` does not work as the container name, just use the container id that you can get by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Once inside the docker container, run the following command to access psql to edit the database:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres
```

Before creating the table, an extension needs to be added:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
```

To create the table for this app, run the following script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_UUID(),
  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  student_id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```
